Dlg_Captain3=Indians live beyond this point - they're pretty martial at the moment.
Dlg_Captain4=Uhm, can't we just pass anyway?
Dlg_Captain5=No, by no means!
Dlg_Captain6=If we would give you a money bag with 50 coins as a sign of our gratefulness, would that change your mind?
Dlg_Captain7=Maybe I could make one exception...
Dlg_Captain8=You got the money?
Dlg_Captain9=Yes, here you are.
Dlg_Captain9b=Not yet.
Dlg_Captain10=Okay, I will open the gates for you.

# Chief #
Dlg_Chief0=We are to help you?
Dlg_Chief1=Yes, the Wolves Tribe accuses us of having stolen the calumet.
Dlg_Chief2=Nothing we could change...
Dlg_Chief3=They don't let us get to the bisons anymore!
Dlg_Chief4=So we are slowly starving. Couldn't you help us out with some food?
Dlg_Chief5=Let me see.. could you give us a horse in return?
Dlg_Chief6=We don't have any, but there are a few wild horses that live right behind our camp.
Dlg_Chief7=Good as well, thank you.
Dlg_Chief8=If you bring us some food, we could offer you some other goods.
Dlg_Chief9=You can trade the food in the main tipi.

Dlg_Chaska7=Yep.

Dlg_Fala6=Oh really? How much?
Dlg_Fala7=Let's say... 30 gold nuggets?
Dlg_Fala8=How about 2?
Dlg_Fala9=No. Put all 30 nuggets in this chest over there.
Dlg_Fala10=If we don't have a choice...
Dlg_Fala11=Oh you're done.
Dlg_Fala11b=The coach isn't there yet.

Dlg_Gaho1=Maybe you can tell us where we can find Ash City?
Dlg_Gaho2=The way is blocked by a magical barrier.
Dlg_Gaho3=That helps us to be safe against bad guys from this region.
Dlg_Gaho4=But I have the feeling they found another way to this place.
Dlg_Gaho5=What do you mean?
Dlg_Gaho6=I heard some strange sounds coming from the vault lately.
Dlg_Gaho7=But we have to go on. How can we pass this barrier?
Dlg_Gaho8=To neutralize the barrier, you'll need the Goblet Of Life.
Dlg_Gaho8b=As long as there is no peace between the tribes, I can't neutralize the barrier.
Dlg_Gaho9=Bring me the goblet and I'll help you.
Dlg_Gaho10=Oh, you found it.

Dlg_Harry4=You are kind!
Dlg_Harry5=Well, not everyone here is. Bandits raided the city not long ago.
Dlg_Harry6=They burnt down almost everything.
Dlg_Harry7=Oh, but we have to go through there.
Dlg_Harry8=They locked the guard tower.
Dlg_Harry9=We just blow it up.
Dlg_Harry10=That's dangerous because of the bridge.
Dlg_Harry11=You'll have to find another way into the city.
Dlg_Harry12=Thanks for your hospitality.
Dlg_Harry13=We could need a covered wagon as your as well.

# Sheriff #
Dlg_Sheriff0=What's going on here?
Dlg_Sheriff1=A horde of bandits raided our city.
Dlg_Sheriff2=They burnt down almost everything.
Dlg_Sheriff3=We made it into this cave.
Dlg_Sheriff4=Could you help us to defeat the bandits?
Dlg_Sheriff5=Actually, we are just on our journey through...
Dlg_Sheriff6=Please defeat all bandits and assist us with rebuilding the city .
Dlg_Sheriff7=Fair enough, we will help you. Otherwise we can't continue our journey anyway...
Dlg_Sheriff8=Are all of them dead yet?
Dlg_Sheriff9=Yes, we killed all bandits.
Dlg_Sheriff9b=No, we aren't done yet.
Dlg_Sheriff10=Their boss must still be hiding somewhere.
Dlg_Sheriff11=We have to arrest him by all means.
Dlg_Sheriff12=How can we do that?
Dlg_Sheriff13=I will accompany you. If he is weakened, I can arrest him.
Dlg_Sheriff14=But first I need my office.
Dlg_Sheriff15=And while you are doing this, you can rebuild the other buildings as well.
Dlg_Sheriff16=Is my office ready yet?
Dlg_Sheriff17=Good as new.
Dlg_Sheriff17b=Not yet.
Dlg_Sheriff18=Alright, I'll come with you. Let's find that bandit boss.
Dlg_Sheriff19=Now they are not a danger anymore.
Dlg_Sheriff20=But he said you'll never reach the Golden Canyon.
Dlg_Sheriff21=Why not?
Dlg_Sheriff22=You'll have to travel through the abandoned mines.
Dlg_Sheriff23=They are locked with three locks.
Dlg_Sheriff24=Two keys are hidden in this area.
Dlg_Sheriff25=But one of the keys he gave to another bandit.
Dlg_Sheriff26=This one fled into the mountains with a horse, so we can't catch him anymore.
Dlg_Sheriff27=Isn't there another way to get the key back?
Dlg_Sheriff28=There is a small village in the mountains, where a colleague lives.
Dlg_Sheriff29=If I could send him a message, he could stop the bandit.
Dlg_Sheriff30=But for that, the telegraph line must be established again. Here take the plan for poles and wire and see to the connection.
Dlg_Sheriff31=Did you repair the line yet?
Dlg_Sheriff32=Yes, you can send the message.
Dlg_Sheriff32b=No, we are still working on it.
Dlg_Sheriff33=Good, I'll send it immediately.
Dlg_Sheriff34=Have you received the key yet?
Dlg_Sheriff35=Yes, here it is.
Dlg_Sheriff35b=No, it takes some time. Why don't you rebuild the other buildings in the meantime?
Dlg_Sheriff36=Thanks.
Dlg_Sheriff37=Thanks for your help with rebuilding the city.
Dlg_SheriffPause=I need a break.
Dlg_SheriffPause2=I need a break. Bring me a piece of cooked meat so I can strengthen me again.

Dlg_Smith3=You built my workshop up again?
Dlg_Smith4=As a sign of my gratefulness I give you the plan of the dynamo. Also I will sell you a cannon for only 50 clunkers. I'm sure you'll need it if you're going to the mines.
Dlg_Smith5=And you'll get the plan for more balls.
Dlg_Smith6=You want to buy a cannon?
Dlg_Smith7=Very well, here's the money.
Dlg_Smith7b=No, maybe later.
Dlg_Smith8=Alright, here is your cannon.
Dlg_Smith8b=That's not enough. A cannon costs 50.

Dlg_Dorkan2=Great! My shop looks like new!
Dlg_Dorkan3=Take those 5 bottles of whisky.
Dlg_Dorkan4=Maybe they will come in handy, because some bandits become very cooperative when you have some whisky to offer.
Dlg_Dorkan5=So take those bottles along into the mines.
Dlg_Dorkan6=Thanks, we'll do that.
Dlg_Dorkan7=Life is great!
