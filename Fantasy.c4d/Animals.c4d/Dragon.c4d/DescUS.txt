The dragon is know to be the mightiest living being in the world of the clonks. His enormous wingspan carries him to any height in the sky. His fiery breath is a danger to anyone who has made himself a dragon's enemy.

Dragons usually live reclusively in their lairs atop mountains or sky islands. Their eggs require the heat of fire applied over a long time in order to hatch.

Skilled magicians have learned the dragon call spell, allowing them to summon a free dragon to their location and mount it to engage their opponent in the sky.
