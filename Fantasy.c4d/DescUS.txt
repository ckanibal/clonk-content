The dragon, mightiest of all living beings in Clonk, will take to the sky with this object pack.

He can be called and subdued by the mage, the most advanced of all magic clonks. The mage can also make use of the numerous new spells included in this pack as well as the spell combo system, an alternative menu structure by which spells can be selected and cast through individual key combinations.

Very advanced apprentices of magic can engage the Alchemy rule, which enables casting spells and composition of special potions through a host of magic ingredients.
